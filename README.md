# miRNA-expression-features-for-SCLC-and-NSCLC-classification

This project uses **miRNA expression data** to classify two lung cancer types:  
- **SCLC** (Small Cell Lung Cancer)  
- **NSCLC** (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer)  

**Dataset:** [Kaggle – miRNA Expression in Human Lung Cancers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gchan357/mirna-expression-in-human-lung-cancers)

## What’s inside
- Data preprocessing & feature selection  
- Machine learning models and neural network for classification  
- Evaluation: accuracy, F1 score
